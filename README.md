### codes

- [Pluto](http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/). Please note that we found a typo in the official code v. 4.3. that causes problem for it to work with python 3.x. We have prepared a [fix](codes/patch_define_problem) that solves this issue. You can download this fixed version from [here](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/raw/master/codes/PLUTO.tar.gz).

### Materials sent by Prof. Kley
-All materials provided by Prof. Kley, including a basic introduction to numerical hydrodynamics, a project focused on linear advection, and some background on programming languages are available [here](https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~kley/talks/mashad/index.html).

-The [Pyro Hydro Code](https://pyro2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Materials sent by Prof. Schäfer
- All the materials sent by [Prof. Christoph Schäfer](https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~schaefer/) for the crash course, including slides and exercises, plus an introduction to N-Body Simulations with REBOUND, could be found [here](https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~schaefer/teach/fum2020/).


### BigBlueButton(BBB)
