- [fft (Fast Fourier transform)](https://github.com/Shenavar/Anaconda-Installation.md/blob/master/fftw3.md)

### codes

- [Pluto](http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/). Please note that we found a typo in the official code v. 4.3. that causes problem for it to work with python 3.x. We have prepared a [fix](codes/patch_define_problem) that solves this issue. You can download this fixed version from [here](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/raw/master/codes/PLUTO.tar.gz).

### Materials sent by Prof. Kley
- All materials provided by Prof. Kley, including a basic introduction to numerical hydrodynamics, a project focused on linear advection, and some background on programming languages are available [here](https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~kley/talks/mashad/index.html).

- The [Pyro Hydro Code](https://pyro2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Materials sent by Dr. Schäfer
- All the materials sent by [Dr. Christoph Schäfer](https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~schaefer/) for the crash course, including slides and exercises, plus an introduction to N-Body Simulations with REBOUND, could be found [here](https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~schaefer/teach/fum2020/).


### Materials sent by Dr. Bhargav Vaidya
- All the materials and explanations sent by [Dr. Bhargav Vaidya](http://www.iiti.ac.in/people/~bvaidya/index.html) could be found [here](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/blob/master/PLUTO-howto.md). This link includes a guide on how to install the latest version of PLUTO and pyPLUTO, if you haven't installed PLUTO already. Also, the link to pyPLUTO compatible for python >3.6 is included in this short manual.

- The pdf files provided by Dr. Bhargav Vaidya, including [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/blob/master/Dr.%20Bhargav%20Vaidya%20Lecture_Notes.pdf), [PLUTO code Essentials](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/blob/master/Dr.%20Bhargav%20Vaidya%20PLUTO_Essentials.pdf) and [A Practical Introduction to the PLUTO Code](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/blob/master/Dr.%20Bhargav%20Vaidya%20PLUTO_WrkShop_Example.pdf) are available now. 


### Materials sent by Prof. Hanawa
- All materials provided by [Prof. Hanawa](https://www.cfs.chiba-u.ac.jp/outline/staff/hanawa.html), including the [slides](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/blob/master/Prof.%20Hanawa%20revised%2020jul29.pdf) and the [notes](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/blob/master/Prof%20Hanawa%20revised%20grav-mashhad20.pdf) of the workshop ( which contains the exact analytical solution of the homework) are now available on our repository. Also, please check [FFTE: A Fast Fourier Transform Package](http://www.ffte.jp/) which is introduced by Prof. Hanawa and includes a package to compute Discrete Fourier Transform.

### BigBlueButton(BBB)

- Please check the [BBB manual](https://github.com/astrofum/na2020/blob/master/BigBlueButton.pdf) to get familiar with the platform.
